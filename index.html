                        <p>The book presents the theme of unending love, finding hope in marriage, discovering partners’
                            needs, as well managing through an affair by beating all challenges as an indomitable team.
                            Harley (2011,17), talks of how partners can avoid extra-marital affairs by advising couples
                            to reflect on their lives, find whether they were happy at one time, and if they were,
                            factor out what they had to find out what have lost to become unhappy.

                            Love faces challenges when couples cannot understand each other, and then it becomes hard to
                            overcome difficulties together. The entire book acknowledges that marriage cannot bring
                            love, affection, and happiness, but the will by both partners to understand each other forms
                            the basis for success in marriage. Many life-opening events arise throughout the book.

                            The book analyzes several concepts that married people tend to get wrong in the process of
                            building their relationships. Other concepts arise when spouses are unhappy, and thus they
                            are unable to settle their differences. Individuals create disparate concepts in
                            relationships.

                            For instance, the concept of building love, trust, and honesty can help a relationship to
                            blossom. Most partners do things according to their perceptions and feelings instead of how
                            their spouses want them to be done. Therefore, the concept of misunderstanding arises, which
                            leads to extra marital affairs. Harley (2011, 23) points to a love bank in a relationship
                            where one can withdraw love.

                        <p>People express and receive love in 5 different ways, called love languages: quality time, words of
                            affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch. The sooner you discover your language and that
                            of your loved one, the sooner you can take your relationship to new heights. And with this summary
                            version of the award-winning book, you don't have to read long to find out.
                            With disarming wit, clear explanations, and inspiring storytelling, Dr. Chapman only needs a moment of
                            your time to transform your love life.

                         <p>Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong
                it may be.

                Criticism is futile because it puts us on the defensive and usually makes us strive to justify
                ourselves. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds our pride, hurts our sense of importance, and
                arouses resentment.

                Don’t criticize others; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.

                “Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbor’s roof when your own doorstep is unclean.”—Confucius

                We’re not logical; we’re emotional, motivated by pride and vanity.
